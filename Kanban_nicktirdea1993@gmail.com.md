**Answer:**

Kanban focuses on breaking down work into small tasks, visualizing them, and getting few items in any given work state. In the Kanban board, work always moves from left to right. And, you pick work from the column to your left when you have completed all your existing work items or when an urgent task surfaces.

There are six core practices you need to observe for successful Kanban implementation:

1. Visualize workflow – The first and most important task is to understand the current flow of work – what is the sequence of steps to execute in order to move an item from request to a deliverable product. This is done using a Kanban board with cards and columns: each column represents a step in your workflow, and each card represents a work item. Every item moves through the flow from start to end. By observing this process, you can easily track progress and identify bottlenecks in real-time.
2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP) – Loss of focus can seriously harm your team’s performance, so this practice centers around eliminating interruptions by setting limits on the work in progress. By applying limits to WIP, teams focus on finishing outstanding work before starting new work. Limiting WIP is critical for the successful implementation of Kanban.
3. Manage flow – By observing and analyzing flow efficiency, you can identify any problem areas. The main goal of implementing Kanban is to create a smooth workflow by improving the lead times and avoiding delays. You should always strive to make your process more efficient.
4. Make process policies explicit – The process should be clearly defined, published, and confirmed for everyone in the team: people won’t feel motivated to be part of something unless they think it will be useful. When everyone is aware of the explicit policies, each person can suggest improvements that will improve your performance.
5. Use feedback loops – In order for the positive change to occur, regular meetings are necessary to provide essential feedback to the entire team. The frequency of these meetings varies, but the idea is that they are regular, at a fixed time, and that they get straight to the point.
6. Improve collaboratively – Kanban requires constant evaluation, analysis, and improvement. When teams have a shared understanding of the process, they are more likely to reach a consensus should any problems arise. The Kanban Method suggests that various models of scientific approach are used to implement continuous, incremental, and evolutionary changes.
